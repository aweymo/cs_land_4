  content: This Capstone will collect, analyze and map historical language in newspapers,
    periodicals, legacy oral history recordings and archival collections describing
    immigrant communities in Washington and Oregon and visualize these trends in language
    and how they may have been influenced by specific commercial interests in the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br><br><br><br><a href="https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id=maplanguage165"

    headline: Purpose
    slug: Purpose
    content: The intention of this work is to bring both the industrial interests
      that influenced media representation, and the lived experience of the communities
      affected by that language down to a human scale. By analyzing these documents
      and noting how different communities were being represented depending on commercial
      interests, we can make new connections and understand the origins of seemingly
      constant cultural perceptions.<br><br>Â· This project serves primarily as a pedagogical
      tool and a methodology for analyzing historical material by increasing access
      points through visual, audio, geospatial and text elements.

    headline: Relevance
    slug: Relevance
    content: Why does this matter? Why air out frequently offensive material from
      over 100 years ago? Just as the categorization of <em>Lesbian</em> and <em>Gay</em>
      topics under <em>Abnormal Psychology, Perversion and Derangement</em> in the
      Dewey Decimal System quietly stigmatized generations, I feel that this language
      may still influence our perceptions of ourselves and other communities, long
      past it's original intended use.<br><br>The lack of accountability in the dissemination
      of hate speech also has parallels with our current condition, where this language
      is now propelled and reflected digitally. Though technology leaders are quick
      to deflect and opine that "you can't put the genie back in the bottle," algorithms,
      and these collected works, have flesh and blood authors behind them, and those
      authors very often have commercial and economic interests behind their creations.

  headline: "<strong>Background</strong>"
  slug: Background
  content: The staying power of this language also has to do with the significance
    of this period in the Pacific Northwest. Our time frame begins ten years before
    the United States Census Bureau declared the closure of the western frontier.
    What follows feels like an ideological rather than physical land grab.<br><br>A<span
    class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>prominent theme throughout this research
    is the concept of "retaining" the American character in Washington and Oregon,
    when it was clearly churning with development. Settlers perpetually gauge other
    immigrant groups on their ability to assimilate or "Americanize," with particular
    focus on differentiating between "New Immigrants" and "Old Immigrants," though
    they may have only arrived within ten years of one another.<br><br>During this
    period in American history, racial animosity was frequently used to divide labor,
    leading immigrant groups to undercut one another to the industrialist's advantage.
    Racial provocations would also be used as a straw man for industrialists to argue
    against anti-monopoly legislation, shape narratives around land development and
    act opportunistically during times of war.
